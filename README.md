Once the Game loads, you're met with a cool parallax effect background and thunder noises in the background. Three game options can be seen.

<h2>Game Intro</h2>

A quick interactive box pops up which kind of gives you a feel of what to expect as the game proceeds. You'll notice on the bottom left corner that there is a game timer, you have exactly 30 seconds to complete this introductory first level. Note: You can pause the game which pauses the timer as well.</br></br>

   <h2>Booby traps</h2>

There are invisible checkpoints once stepped on will activate lethal arrows thrown to your direction. These arrows affect your Lwanda player's health and you might want to be careful. Also watch out for sharp objects popping out of nowhere (^_^).</b></br>

<h2>Game Over</h2>

If you do not finish the obstacle course in time or you run out of health, well....Bye bye! you can restart and try as many times as you want.</br></br>

<h2>Useful info</h2>
Some additional features that I am yet to implement are:
1. A High Score System.(With an international scores board using an API, to see the best performing player worldwide).</br>
2. Extra levels(currently only has level 1).</br></br>
3. Since I used a player sheet for each individual player movement, some more actions are needed.(Requires a bit of designing/animation).
